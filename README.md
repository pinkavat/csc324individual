*"This site demonstrates my developed technical understanding of the general bootstrapping process for a Rails site, the use of Railsâ€™ ERB and partials to supplement traditional HTML/CSS, the creation of forms that generate both GET and POST requests, and the creation, addition of elements to, and reading of a database."* -- from the project writeup
